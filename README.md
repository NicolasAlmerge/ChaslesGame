# Chasles Game

A fun and very unique game to learn about vector operations visually.

After compilation, the game starts as a 5Ã—5 grid, consisting of 20 blocks. Each block is like a vector, with two color endpoints and a coefficient.
The black boxes represent the empty cells, or the zero vector.

Using the given buttons, you can move the blocks around to combine them!

In the example below, moving the piece on the far left of the fourth line to the right combines the two blocks together using the vector addition rule.
Mathematically, this is represented as: 2AB + 2BC = 2AC).

Another example of combination is shown below with the two blocks at the bottom of the middle column, still using the vector addition rule.
The mathematical representation of this operation is: 1CD + 2CD = 3CD.

If no combination is possible, blocks are simply swaped without changes. Below is an example of swapping the two adjacent top blocks with coefficient two.

The goal of the game is to combine as much as possible to get one block at the end. Thanks to the way the blocks are built, this is always possible!
